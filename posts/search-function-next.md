Next.js is a React framework that includes many out-of-the-box features available, such as routing, code-splitting and server-side rendering.

In version 9 (https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9), API Routing was introduced to the framework — making it easier than ever to introduce API endpoints to a Next.js application.

The official website provides an example tutorial, covering the fundamentals of the framework— showing you how to build a markdown blog in Next.js.

In this article let’s take a look at how to build upon the Next.js example application, extending the functionality by integrating a search component.
